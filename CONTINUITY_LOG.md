Uhm I don't see the client opening when I "npm run electron". I only see [electron] synced strophe runtime -> /home/duda/discord-lookalike-flash/vendor/strophe.umd.min.js
synced ruffle runtime -> /home/duda/discord-lookalike-flash/vendor/ruffle/ruffle.js

Please add this to LLM instructions as well so future LLMs really know! Also there should be a note that this stuff is LLM generated in the README and at the beginning (below the screenshot) should be instructions on how to run the electron and how to make a binary that can be run independently. Oh also what about IRC support? I think that could be achieved easily.

Okay. One issue: Imagine I'm trying to press one of the buttons of the privacy gate and thus I'm moving my mouse from below into it. But then the link shows and the buttons get pushed down. Can you make sure the buttons stay in place and instead the other stuff is pushed up? Then why when I upload files do other receive date-URLs? Looks also like receiving attachments like images takes long. Then when I'm logged in with derberg and writing with kazue why do I see two chats for derberg and kazue that belong together? Then why are the GIFs in the GIF picker so small? They all should be displayed with a minimum size. Then when I ESC the fullscreen from SWF PiP the SWF should not stop playing. Also why can't I resize the SWF PiP and the video dock? Then outside of PiP/dock please do not show controls for videos or SWFs when not hovering over the videos or SWFs or their controls themself. Then can you make sure there is automatic prevention to have the PiP/dock covering the input area? If it somehow covers it after e.g. launching it or resizing the window then immiadetly move it up in y direction. Then the video dock somehow doesn't allow collapsing similar to the SWF PiP? Please feel free to implement other stuff as well.
