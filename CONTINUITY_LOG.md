Please add this to LLM instructions as well so future LLMs really know! Also there should be a note that this stuff is LLM generated in the README and at the beginning (below the screenshot) should be instructions on how to run the electron and how to make a binary that can be run independently. Oh also what about IRC support? I think that could be achieved easily.
