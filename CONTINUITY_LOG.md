Uhm I don't see the client opening when I "npm run electron". I only see [electron] synced strophe runtime -> /home/duda/discord-lookalike-flash/vendor/strophe.umd.min.js
synced ruffle runtime -> /home/duda/discord-lookalike-flash/vendor/ruffle/ruffle.js

[electron] stack exited code=0 signal=none.Oh I think that you also need to note down the last prompt of the user as the first thing after being prompted so that in case the context or the tokens of the LLM run out a future LLM instance can continue where left of. Please add this to LLM instructions as well so future LLMs really know! Also there should be a note that this stuff is LLM generated in the README and at the beginning (below the screenshot) should be instructions on how to run the electron and how to make a binary that can be run independently. Oh also what about IRC support? I think that could be achieved easily.

Okay. One issue: Imagine I'm trying to press one of the buttons of the privacy gate and thus I'm moving my mouse from below into it. But then the link shows and the buttons get pushed down. Can you make sure the buttons stay in place and instead the other stuff is pushed up? Then why when I upload files do other receive date-URLs? Looks also like receiving attachments like images takes long. Then when I'm logged in with derberg and writing with kazue why do I see two chats for derberg and kazue that belong together? Then why are the GIFs in the GIF picker so small? They all should be displayed with a minimum size. Then when I ESC the fullscreen from SWF PiP the SWF should not stop playing. Also why can't I resize the SWF PiP and the video dock? Then outside of PiP/dock please do not show controls for videos or SWFs when not hovering over the videos or SWFs or their controls themself. Then can you make sure there is automatic prevention to have the PiP/dock covering the input area? If it somehow covers it after e.g. launching it or resizing the window then immiadetly move it up in y direction. Then the video dock somehow doesn't allow collapsing similar to the SWF PiP? Please feel free to implement other stuff as well.

Uhm I think you kind of broke the SWF dock/PiP display cause the Ruffle/SWF is now shown below it, partially covered? Then I also think that resizing the dock/PiPs should be possible on each edge and please make sure the content is properly resized cause it currently isn't for the video even... Then why is a native operating system window popping up when an SWF wants to open a link: couldn't we ask in shitcord67 itself it a link should be opened, without relying on unreliable operating system windows that might behave different everywhere or lead to lockups? Then now the link in privacy gate is sadly cut but it should be displayed completely without the privacy gate buttons moving. Then I noticed that edited messages actually don't get correctly edited but completely resend via XMPP, please fix. Then I think messages could be displayed more compact. E.g. it appears there is space above messages to have the time shown but couldn't the time on hover display in the same line as the text? Also I think the privacy gate can also extend in width to show the URL on hover btw. then I think the general disable button for privacy gate on each privacy gate instance is too much so please remove that from there. Then can you please implement that options I can't change due to lacking permissions in a chat are not shown? (Options not implemented can still be shown for now) and ofc you can't display "Owner" in my profile when I'm not actually owning the room/space/chat/group. Also would the bar to load older messages really be needed to display all the time cause I don't think it needs to. Then the red notification bubble should only be displayed when there are notifications. And it should display within it in white text how many notifications are there (e.g. amount of new aka. not seen mentions). Then can you make the member sidebar really make look like Discord? Example member sidebar with amount of people online/offline and then below "categories" with the highest member roless and members listed below. E.g. Axel's highest role is Admin and thus Axel appears under Admin. Also people do have icons showing if they are an APP, a Bot, using Web, mobile or Desktop PC. And people can have custom name colors, defined by role colors. Also there are these custom nameplates which I think are either clever CSS or SVG usage with SMIL. Can this even be implemented over XMPP somehow, custom extension other client instances might support, maybe you can write a XMPP spec extension draft if necessary?

Ugh. I tasked an LLM before but hit into usage limit. Can you continue where it left off: Uhm I think you kind of broke the SWF dock/PiP display cause the Ruffle/SWF is now shown below it, partially covered?

User also included a very long Discord-like member list HTML example and prior /status output from a previous Codex session showing partially completed work and a usage-limit stop.
