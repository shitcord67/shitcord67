Please add this to LLM instructions as well so future LLMs really know! Also there should be a note that this stuff is LLM generated in the README and at the beginning (below the screenshot) should be instructions on how to run the electron and how to make a binary that can be run independently. Oh also what about IRC support? I think that could be achieved easily.

Okay. One issue: Imagine I'm trying to press one of the buttons of the privacy gate and thus I'm moving my mouse from below into it. But then the link shows and the buttons get pushed down. Can you make sure the buttons stay in place and instead the other stuff is pushed up? Then why when I upload files do other receive date-URLs? Looks also like receiving attachments like images takes long. Then when I'm logged in with derberg and writing with kazue why do I see two chats for derberg and kazue that belong together? Then why are the GIFs in the GIF picker so small? They all should be displayed with a minimum size. Then when I ESC the fullscreen from SWF PiP the SWF should not stop playing. Also why can't I resize the SWF PiP and the video dock? Then outside of PiP/dock please do not show controls for videos or SWFs when not hovering over the videos or SWFs or their controls themself. Then can you make sure there is automatic prevention to have the PiP/dock covering the input area? If it somehow covers it after e.g. launching it or resizing the window then immiadetly move it up in y direction. Then the video dock somehow doesn't allow collapsing similar to the SWF PiP? Please feel free to implement other stuff as well.

## 2026-02-21T02:18:59+01:00

Uhm I think you kind of broke the SWF dock/PiP display cause the Ruffle/SWF is now shown below it, partially covered? Then I also think that resizing the dock/PiPs should be possible on each edge and please make sure the content is properly resized cause it currently isn't for the video even... Then why is a native operating system window popping up when an SWF wants to open a link: couldn't we ask in shitcord67 itself it a link should be opened, without relying on unreliable operating system windows that might behave different everywhere or lead to lockups? Then now the link in privacy gate is sadly cut but it should be displayed completely without the privacy gate buttons moving. Then I noticed that edited messages actually don't get correctly edited but completely resend via XMPP, please fix. Then I think messages could be displayed more compact. E.g. it appears there is space above messages to have the time shown but couldn't the time on hover display in the same line as the text? Also I think the privacy gate can also extend in width to show the URL on hover btw. then I think the general disable button for privacy gate on each privacy gate instance is too much so please remove that from there. Then can you please implement that options I can't change due to lacking permissions in a chat are not shown? (Options not implemented can still be shown for now) and ofc you can't display "Owner" in my profile when I'm not actually owning the room/space/chat/group. Also would the bar to load older messages really be needed to display all the time cause I don't think it needs to. Then the red notification bubble should only be displayed when there are notifications. And it should display within it in white text how many notifications are there (e.g. amount of new aka. not seen mentions). Then can you make the member sidebar really make look like Discord? Example member sidebar with amount of people online/offline and then below "categories" with the highest member roless and members listed below. E.g. Axel's highest role is Admin and thus Axel appears under Admin. Also people do have icons showing if they are an APP, a Bot, using Web, mobile or Desktop PC. And people can have custom name colors, defined by role colors. Also there are these custom nameplates which I think are either clever CSS or SVG usage with SMIL. Can this even be implemented over XMPP somehow, custom extension other client instances might support, maybe you can write a XMPP spec extension draft if necessary?

Ugh. I tasked an LLM before but hit into usage limit.

User also included a very long Discord-like member list HTML example and prior /status output from a previous Codex session showing partially completed work and a usage-limit stop.

I noticed that when I'm resizing Ruffle in-chat that it flickers a lot. Can't you maybe increase the message height live to prevent that? Also why can't I see the SWF when the SWF PiP is open? Could it be that it is displayed behind the PiP window we create? Also can you please not use system native dialogs to ask if I want to reset the SWF... couldn't you use a HTML pop-up maybe altert-style thing for that or popover or commandfor? Then for privacy gates, why is there sometimes some space between the button and the domain while the link is hidden? Then could you implement proper attachment sending via XMPP? Cause I see "1 local attachment not shareable over relay]" in Gajim. Also could you have a visual attachment preview (before sending an attachment) just like Discord? Then can you not display "Open in new tab" for videos and can you not display "Download SVG" in chat? For images/SVGs I think there should be a download button when I open them in the zoomed in display (after clicking once) and there should also be context menu options to copy e.g. link. Also does "Load older message" really need to be displayed all the time? Feel free to implement more stuff

A previous LLM tried this: XMPP HTTP upload (so local attachments become real links), OOB attachment stanza metadata, and the
  missing CSS fixes (privacy-gate spacing, lightbox actions/confirm styling, composer attachment thumbnails). Then I’ll run syntax
  checks.

## 2026-02-21T02:52:29Z
Great. Then I noticed I can't properly react to messages by using the three emojis from the message hover menu. They don't seem to get added on click. Also I noticed that e.g. when controls for an SWF or video are shown and then I try to reach the message hover menu that stuff can jump around cause the message hover menu is displayed a bit above the message (basically in the next above message), so maybe move it a bit further down? Then can you make the video dock resize properly like the SWF PiP. In fact, why aren't you reusing code from the SWF PiP for the video dock? Aren't they basically the same? Also are reactions actually properly implemented and using XMPP? Cause in a chat I see "/me retracted a previous message, but it's unsupported by your client." Then is displaying "Load older messages" all the time really necessary? Then can't you display the proper room/group/chat/space title/name at the top? And the description below. Then I think the button to hide channels makes everything shift to the right which is a heavy UX bug. Feel free to implement more

Okay. why is it now that I don't seem to see DMs anymore? "Loading older messages..." is the only thing I see in direct message XMPP chats...

Btw. when there are HTML files in chat, why is a save prompt dialog popping up the moment I open a chat without me having clicked anything to download the HTML? Also can you make sure that the video and SWF embeds are starting a bit higher in the message and that the open controls do not close while I'm over the message hover menu to e.g. select a reaction? Also why are the reactions not working? Also why are the GIFs in the GIF picker not having a minimum height and width Please never display them below 100x100 size.

Also then for the GIF picker, why don't I get the privacy gate-like options and just GIF and video hidden message? Also why is the room/space/group description not displayed below the room/space/group title?

## 2026-02-21T04:09:47Z
Looks like it works now again? Anyways, why are reactions I apply are still not getting send to other people – looks like I get at least their reactions – and why do I see 2 reactions for DM channels when I only reacted once? Feel free to add more stuff you deem worth adding

- Prompt: Also I noticed that when I click on a user profile that I don't see the avatar displayed there.

## 2026-02-21T05:12:44+01:00
- Prompt: Then what I also noticed is that there is always a red notification bubble at the shitcord67 logo. But it should only be present when I actually got messages or (new) mentions.
