# shitcord67 TODO

## Done (basic MVP)
- Username login.
- Discord-like multi-pane layout (server rail, channel list, chat, profile card).
- Local profile customization: bio, avatar color, banner color or URL.
- Profile image upload with validation and preview.
- Create servers (guilds).
- Create text channels.
- Send messages as logged-in user.
- Message editing/deleting.
- Reply threading and basic message reactions.
- Per-guild member list with presence groups.
- Channel topic + channel settings.
- Slash commands (`/me`, `/shrug`, `/clear`, `/topic`, `/nick`, `/status`, `/markread`) with live popup.
- Import/export JSON snapshot for backup/testing.
- Right-click context menus for guilds/channels/messages/users.
- Keyboard navigation for context menus (arrow/enter/esc).
- Unread + mention badges for channels and guild rail with mark-as-read actions.
- Channel list filter/search input.
- Discord-like media picker (GIF/sticker/emoji/SWF/SVG tabs) with search and click-to-send.
- HTML media tab + HTML embed rendering in chat attachments.
- DM sidebar with 1:1 direct-message threads.
- User profile notes (private notes per account/user pair).
- Guild folder grouping in server rail.
- OLED theme mode with Appearance toggle.
- Per-guild nicknames via profile editor and `/nick`.
- Per-guild avatar variants via profile editor.
- Per-guild banner variants via profile editor.
- Guild-scoped status override (separate from global status).
- Custom status emoji + timed expiry presets (30m/1h/4h/today).
- Channel type variants (text/announcement/forum/media) with distinct labels.
- DM search/quick switch via sidebar filter and Enter-to-open.
- Nested context-menu submenus for grouped actions.
- DM-only sidebar mode toggled via top `S67` button.
- Top DM switcher uses emoji-style icon and shows DM unread/mention badge.
- Quick DM input in user popout (send without leaving profile card).
- Role color applied to member list, message usernames, and profile names.
- DM unread divider + jump-to-newest control in DM threads.
- Forum channel messages render as post-style cards.
- Local SWF catalog generated in `swf-index.json`.
- Guild custom emoji + sticker/media imports from URL or local files.
- Basic markdown-style message formatting (bold/italic/code/strike/quotes/links).
- Auto-runtime bootstrap for Ruffle and dotLottie in app startup.
- Add per-message debug inspector pane with decoded attachment/network info.
- Add true detachable SWF mini-player (PiP-like floating window) independent of channel view.
- Local persistence via browser storage for easy debugging and rapid iteration.

## Near-term
- Per-guild notification settings (mute/mentions only/all).
- WebXDC packaging path: `.xdc` zip, `manifest.toml`, and realtime sync via `joinRealtimeChannel().send`.
- Bundle Ruffle locally (self-hosted script) and support richer SWF controls/fallback.
- dotLottie controls parity (pause/speed/scrub) and richer APNG/sticker management.
- Add provider-backed GIF/sticker search adapter (GIPHY/Tenor) with local fallback.

## Protocol/transport path
- Define transport adapter interface (`send`, `subscribe`, `fetchHistory`, `presence`).
- Build `local-json` adapter first (file-backed or websocket-backed).
- Add XMPP adapter skeleton (MUC rooms mapped to guild/channel abstraction).
- Add Matrix adapter skeleton (space/room mapping).

## Existing ideas to revisit
- If possible make it Discord-API or discord.js compatible.
- WebXDC.
- SVG display support in chat.
- In-line slash commands with rich media embeds.
- GIF and sticker picker with provider consent and local fallback.
- Forums: https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0508.html
- XMPP Whiteboard plugin.
- Multiple accounts logged in at the same time.
- Remote XMPP server developer interface (for example ejabberd).
- SVG/SWF picker for flash and SVG animations.

## Discord parity targets (from official docs)
- Per-server profiles and avatar variants.
- Rich status and custom status flow.
- Thread channels for focused sub-conversations.
- Forum channels with post-style discussion.
- Full slash-command command palette and app command support.
- Channel type expansion (voice, stage, announcement/media-like channel support).
- Upload flow + media embeds + sticker/GIF experience.
- Reactions on messages.
- Full user settings breadth (privacy, notifications, keybinds, accessibility, voice/video).

## Others (user added to TODO, feel free to reposition)
- Clients should build a P2P network and attachments should be stored there to make expensive server storage unnecessary
- Group servers/guild together
- Vencord-like plugins
- Widgets like Element Matrix messenger
- More XMPP spec extensions
- Read more on Discord blogpost about features, investigate screenshots
- in-line chat slash commands like Telegram (featuring images poppin up fitting to context e.g. cards for a uno game run by an application bot)
- Direct messages to users. In the lower-left of the client or by clicking on username or user list when profile pops open there is a chat input field
- Save notes about users on profiles of other users
- OLED theme by default (with considerations for blue light filter users. Mentions in white, green or red?)
- Add full nested context menu variants (invite/copy-id/submenus) and keyboard navigation.
- Markdown support (preferably Discord-compatible, maybe even more like GitHub-flavoured?)
- Discord embeds
- Discord RPC
- Implement PDF viewer in chat
- Implement local Linux terminal emulator with some syntax to run some commands, SIXEL display?
- WASM applications, console emulators for e.g. Nintendo, some co-op stuff...
- cohost-like CSS crimes blogs
- Blogs accessible on user profiles
- Display simple HTML files in chat.
- HTMl formatting of messages
- Full-fledged image editor, sticker and animation maker
- Support openraster
- Option to send mails? shitcord67 as a mail client with option to save mail files?
- Get inspiration from chinese WeChat which is the everything app, lol
- The guild channel sidebar and the DM sidebar should be seperate. The DM sidebar should only be visible when clicking at the top icon (S67 for now, maybe replace with SVG version of 🫪  emoi)
- Please split the sign-in/welcome back part from the actual application. By that I mean I don't want to be able to scroll up/down to the different parts...
- [done] A person creating a guild should by default have owner permissions over it, allowed to do everything regarding it.
- [done] Do not show SWF options in context menu when no SWF is in message
- [done] Do not overlay custom context menu when right-clicking over Ruffle
