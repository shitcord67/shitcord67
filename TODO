# shitcord67 TODO

## Done (basic MVP)
- Username login.
- Discord-like multi-pane layout (server rail, channel list, chat, profile card).
- Local profile customization: bio, avatar color, banner color or URL.
- Create servers (guilds).
- Create text channels.
- Send messages as logged-in user.
- Local persistence via browser storage for easy debugging and rapid iteration.

## Near-term
- Add message editing/deleting.
- Add reply threading and basic message reactions.
- Add per-server members list.
- Add channel topic + channel settings.
- Add simple slash commands (`/me`, `/shrug`, `/clear`).
- Add import/export JSON snapshot for backup and testing.
- Add profile image upload and validation.

## Protocol/transport path
- Define transport adapter interface (`send`, `subscribe`, `fetchHistory`, `presence`).
- Build `local-json` adapter first (file-backed or websocket-backed).
- Add XMPP adapter skeleton (MUC rooms mapped to guild/channel abstraction).
- Add Matrix adapter skeleton (space/room mapping).

## Existing ideas to revisit
- If possible make it Discord-API or discord.js compatible.
- WebXDC.
- SVG display support in chat.
- In-line slash commands with rich media embeds.
- GIF and sticker picker with provider consent and local fallback.
- Forums: https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0508.html
- XMPP Whiteboard plugin.
- Multiple accounts logged in at the same time.
- Remote XMPP server developer interface (for example ejabberd).
- SVG/SWF picker for flash and SVG animations.

## Discord parity targets (from official docs)
- Per-server profiles and avatar variants.
- Rich status and custom status flow.
- Thread channels for focused sub-conversations.
- Forum channels with post-style discussion.
- Full slash-command command palette and app command support.
- Channel type expansion (voice, stage, announcement/media-like channel support).
- Upload flow + media embeds + sticker/GIF experience.
- Reactions on messages.
- Full user settings breadth (privacy, notifications, keybinds, accessibility, voice/video).

## Others (user added to TODO, feel free to reposition)
- Clients should build a P2P network and attachments should be stored there to make expensive server storage unnecessary
- Group servers/guild together
- Vencord-like plugins
- Widgets like Element Matrix messenger
- More XMPP spec extensions
- Read more on Discord blogpost about features, investigate screenshots
- in-line chat slash commands like Telegram (featuring images poppin up fitting to context e.g. cards for a uno game run by an application bot)
- Direct messages to users. In the lower-left of the client or by clicking on username or user list when profile pops open there is a chat input field
- Save notes about users on profiles of other users
- OLED theme by default
